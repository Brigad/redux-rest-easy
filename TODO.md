# TODO

While redux-rest-easy is now production ready (we have been using it for several months at Brigad), there are a few things which could be improved:

* Provide a way to handle the token in getDefaultNetworkHelpers, so that the default helpers are a viable solution
* Bring unit testing to 100% (on the lower-level functions of the library)
* Do integration testing on the high-level functions of the library
* Create an example sections, with small projects depicting common use cases
* Cleaner, easier to get around documentation, on a Gatsby-powered website instead of Github (e.g. https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
